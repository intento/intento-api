## Overview

### Intents

Intento API provides a uniform intent-based access to cognitive services from multiple providers, available at the Intento Service Platform. The intent is a basic action (like `translate`).

Currently, the following intents are available:

- Text
    - [Text translation][ai.text.translate] `ai.text.translate`, [Demo][ai.text.translate.demo]
    - [Sentiment analysis][ai.text.sentiment] `ai.text.sentiment`, [Demo][ai.text.sentiment.demo]
    - [Dictionary][ai.text.dictionary] `ai.text.dictionary`, [Demo][ai.text.dictionary.demo]
    - [Text classify][ai.text.classify] `ai.text.classify`, [Catalog][ai.text.classify.catalog]
    - [Transliterate][ai.text.transliterate] `ai.text.transliterate`, [Demo][ai.text.transliterate.demo]
- Image
    - [Tag images](ai.image.tagging.md) `ai.image.tagging`, [Demo][ai.image.tagging.demo]
    - [OCR][ai.image.ocr] `ai.image.ocr`, [Catalog][ai.image.ocr.catalog]
- Speech
    - [Transcribe Speech][ai.speech.transcribe] `ai.speech.transcribe`, [Catalog][ai.speech.transcribe.catalog]

Intent APIs are accessed via the base path. That said, API for the Machine Translation intent (ai.text.translate) is available at `/ai/text/translate`.

### Using the API

In order to get a list of providers available for some intent, use `GET` requests. Some providers support a subset of all available inputs for an intent. For example, not every Machine Translation service supports Korean to Russian language pair. To get a list of providers that support particular inputs, specify the input data constraints in GET parameters (see below).

In order to fulfill an intent (e.g. translate some text), use `POST` requests. The request is routed to a provider that supports the input data. In order to control the provider selection process, you may specify the bidding strategy or identifier of the particular provider to use.

All methods of the Intento API return JSON responses.

Some of the features described below are supported in the testing branch of our API. They are marked by :lock:. Please contact us to enable these features for your API key.

### Error handling

Intento uses the standard HTTP error reporting format for the JSON API. Successful requests return HTTP status codes in the 2xx range. Failed requests return status codes in the 4xx and 5xx ranges. Requests that require a redirect returns status codes in the 3xx range.

### Authentication and keys

Currently, we use the token-based authentication via headers (more on that [below](#authentication)). If this is inconvenient for you, let us know. We always strive to support all use-cases our clients have in mind.

We enable cross-origin resource sharing support for our API so that you can use it right from the web application. However, be careful with your access keys. If you think your access credentials are compromised, let us know. We will give you new credentials and consult on how to take care of them.

### Paying for services

Third-party services may be paid via Intento (the default scenario) or via your own account at the third party service. In order to use your own account at the third party service, specify the account credentials as described below. NOTE: some of the services are available only with your own accounts (i.e. we don’t have a billing integration with them).

### Additional feature

Intento Service Platform provides additional feature for useful work.

Currently, the following features are available:

- [Usage API][usage.md] - to get usage statistics about all calls to the API
- [Score API][score.md] - a set of API methods to calculate reference-based scores (such as BLEU) on user input
- Evaluation API - to evaluate third-party API models

## Authentication

We use the token-based authentication. Each request to intento API should pass an access key in header `apikey` as demonstrated in the examples below.

For each account, we provide two keys, a real key and a sandbox one. Requests performed with the real key are actually fulfilled via third-party services and billed towards your account. Usage limits for real keys are governed by the subscription tier you have. Requests performed with the sandbox key are intended for testing purposes and return some sample responses. Usage limits for sandbox keys are quite low, let us know if anything is wrong with that.

## Usage limits

The following limits apply to the production keys:

- Requests per second: 100
- Requests per month: 1,000,000
- Data per request: 100MB
- Provider specific limits

Remaining limits are returned with a response in headers: `X-RateLimit-Remaining-second`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining-month`

When the limits as exceeded, Intento API will return a HTTP error 429 (see below).

In case if your request exceeds limits you can use [the async mode][async-mode]. The current approach to handling the oversized requests [is described in a separate document][processing-oversized-requests].

## Errors

Error responses usually include a JSON document in the response body, which contains information about the error. [In async mode](#async-errors), response also includes a specific position of the error.

Error codes:

- `400` -- Provider-related errors.
- `401` -- Intento: Auth key is missing
- `403` -- Intento: Auth key is invalid
- `404` -- Intento: Intent/Provider not found
- `413` -- Intento: Capabilities mismatch for the chosen provider (too long text, unsupported languages, etc)
- `429` -- Intento: API rate limit exceeded
- `500` -- Intento: Internal error
- `501` -- Intento: Not implemented. The server lacks the ability to fulfil the request. Will be implemented in future.
- `502` -- Intento: Gateway timeout

## Basic usage

A simple example of how to use Intento API.

To translate a text, send a POST request to Intento API at [https://api.inten.to/ai/text/translate](https://api.inten.to/ai/text/translate). Specify the source text, the target language and the desired translation provider in JSON body of the request as in the following example:

```sh
curl -XPOST -H 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY' 'https://api.inten.to/ai/text/translate' -d '{
    "context": {
        "text": "A sample text",
        "to": "es"
    },
    "service": {
        "provider": "ai.text.translate.microsoft.translator_text_api.2-0"
    }
}'
```

Proceed to the following links for more details and examples on how to use a particular intent.

- Text
    - [Text translation][ai.text.translate] `ai.text.translate`
    - [Sentiment analysis][ai.text.sentiment] `ai.text.sentiment`
    - [Dictionary][ai.text.dictionary] `ai.text.dictionary`
    - [Text classify](ai.text.classify.md) `ai.text.classify`
    - [Transliterate](ai.text.transliterate.md) `ai.text.transliterate`
- Image
    - [Tag images](ai.image.tagging.md) `ai.image.tagging`
    - [OCR](ai.image.ocr.md) `ai.image.ocr`
- Speech
    - [Transcribe Speech](ai.speech.transcribe.md) `ai.speech.transcribe`

## Advanced usage

### :lock: Multi mode

In the multi mode, the request is performed using a list of providers.
The mode is activated by passing an array of provider's identificators.

```sh
curl -XPOST -H 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY' 'https://api.inten.to/ai/text/translate' -d '{
    "context": {
        "text": "A sample text",
        "to": "es"
    },
    "service": {
        "provider": [
            "ai.text.translate.google.translate_api.2-0",
            "ai.text.translate.yandex.translate_api.1-5"
        ]
    }
}'
```

Response:

```json
{
    "response": [
        {
            "results": [
                "Un texto de ejemplo"
            ],
            "meta": {},
            "service": {
                "provider": {
                    "id": "ai.text.translate.microsoft.translator_text_api.2-0",
                    "name": "Microsoft Translator API"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "results": [
                "Un texto de ejemplo"
            ],
            "meta": {},
            "service": {
                "provider": {
                    "id": "ai.text.translate.yandex.translate_api.1-5",
                    "name": "Yandex Translate API"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Async mode

If the server responded with a status of 413 (Request Entity Too Large), then the request data is too large for the synchronous processing. In this case, you should switch to the asynchronous mode by setting `service.async` to `true`. The current approach to handling the oversized requests [is described in a separate document](https://github.com/intento/intento-api/blob/master/processing-oversized-requests.md).

```sh
curl -XPOST -H 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY' 'https://api.inten.to/ai/text/translate' -d '{
    "context": {
        "text": [
           "Large text corpus"
        ],
        "to": "es",
        "from": en
    },
    "service": {
        "provider": [
            "ai.text.translate.microsoft.translator_text_api.2-0"
        ],
        "async": true
    }
}'
```

The response contains `id` of the operation:

```json
{
    "id": "ea1684f1-4ec7-431d-9b7e-bfbe98cf0bda"
}
```

Wait for processing to complete. To retrieve the result of the operation,
make a GET request to the `https://api.inten.to/operations/YOUR_OPERATION_ID`.
TTL of the resource is 30 days.

```json
{
    "id": "ea1684f1-4ec7-431d-9b7e-bfbe98cf0bda",
    "done": true,
    "response": [
        {
            "results": [
                "Translated large text corpus"
            ],
            "meta": {},
            "service": {
                "provider": {
                    "id": "ai.text.translate.microsoft.translator_text_api.2-0",
                    "name": "Microsoft Translator API"
                }
            }
        }
    ],
    "error": null
}
```

If the operation is not completed the value of `done` is false. Wait and make request later.

```json
{
    "id": "ea1684f1-4ec7-431d-9b7e-bfbe98cf0bda",
    "done": false,
    "response": null,
    "error": null
}
```

#### Async errors

If the operation encountered an error during fulfillment, you would see a response with partial result and error. This result contains successfully fulfilled elements of the initial request and nulls where the error occurred. More information about the cause of the problem you can find in an error object. The object contains a list of failed requests with corresponding error responses. For more convenient mapping there is an item key and a position key in the object. The `item` key is an index of the element in the initial request array. And the `position` key is an index of the element in the [sub-array][processing-oversized-requests]. Here is an example of the operation which failed:

```json
{
    "id": "72eaec95-da77-463c-877a-def06b357888",
    "done": true,
    "response": [
        {
            "results": [
                "Translated response 1",
                "Translated response 2",
                null,
                "Translated response 4"
            ],
            "meta": {
                "detected_source_language": [
                    "en"
                ]
            },
            "service": {
                "provider": {
                    "id": "provider_id",
                    "name": "Provider Name"
                }
            }
        }
    ],
    "error": {
        "type": "AsyncSecondaryError",
        "reason": "One or more of async operations return an error",
        "data": [
            {
                "item": 3,
                "position": 0,
                "error": true,
                "provider_id": "provider_id",
                "request": {
                    "url": "https://api.inten.to/ai/text/translate/",
                    "method": "POST",
                    "body": "{\"context\": {\"from\": \"ru\", \"to\": \"en\", \"text\": \"Непереведенный ответ 3\"}, \"service\": {\"provider\": [\"provider_id\"]}}"
                },
                "response": {
                    "body": {
                        "error": {
                            "code": 413,
                            "message": "Provider provider_id constraint(s) violated: Constraint violated for parameter text: max-item-length=10, passed value length=22"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Debug mode

Intento do not keep payload in logs, but in some cases it may be useful for debugging. Saving data in logs can be controlled using the boolean flag `trace`.

There are three ways to set the `trace` flag:

#### request header

```sh
curl -XPOST -H 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY' -H 'trace: true' 'https://api.inten.to/ai/text/translate' -d {
...
}
```

#### request arguments

```sh
curl -XPOST -H 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY' 'https://api.inten.to/ai/text/translate?trace=true' -d {
...
}
```

#### request body in `service`

```sh
curl -XPOST -H 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY' -H 'trace: true' 'https://api.inten.to/ai/text/translate' -d {
    "context": {
        "text": "A sample text",
        "to": "es"
    },
    "service": {
        "provider": [
            "ai.text.translate.google.translate_api.2-0"
        ],
        "trace": true
    }
}
```

If flag do not set or set `false` we do not keep user payload in logs. Flag name is case insensitive.

### Using a service provider with your own keys

Intento supports two modes of using 3rd party services:

- full proxy: 3rd party service used via Intento and paid to the Intento (available for some of the services).
- tech proxy: 3rd party service used via our user's own credentials and billed towards the user's account at the third-party service (available for all services).

In the tech proxy mode, the custom credentials are passed in the `auth` service field. `auth` field is a dictionary, it's keys are provider IDs. For each ID specify your own key(s) you want to use and values set to a list of keys for the specified provider. There could be more than one key for the provider in the case you want to work with a pool of keys (more on this advanced feature later).

Auth object structure is different for different providers and may be obtained together with other provider details by sending GET request for this provider:

```sh
curl -H 'apikey: YOUR_INTENTO_KEY' 'https://api.inten.to/ai/text/translate/ai.text.translate.google.translate_api.2-0'
```

Response:

```json
{
    "id": "ai.text.translate.google.translate_api.2-0",
    "name": "Google Cloud Translation API",
    "logo": "https://inten.to/img/api/ggl_translate.png",
    "auth": {
        "key": "YOUR_KEY"
    },
    "billing": true,
    "bulk": true,
    "languages": {
        "symmetric": [
            "gu",
            "gd",
            "ga",
            "gl",
            "lb"
        ],
        "pairs": [
            [
                [
                    "en",
                    "de"
                ],
                [
                    "fr",
                    "en"
                ]
            ]
        ]
    }
}'
```

```sh
curl -XPOST -H 'apikey: YOUR_INTENTO_KEY' 'https://api.inten.to/ai/text/translate' -d '{
    "context": {
        "text": "A sample text",
        "to": "es"
    },
    "service": {
        "provider": "ai.text.translate.google.translate_api.2-0",
        "auth": {
            "ai.text.translate.google.translate_api.2-0": [
                {
                    "key": "YOUR_GOOGLE_KEY"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}'
```

Response:

```json
{
    "results": [
        "Un texto de muestra"
    ],
    "meta": {
        "detected_source_language": [
            "en"
        ]
    },
    "service": {
        "provider": {
            "id": "ai.text.translate.google.translate_api.2-0",
            "name": "Google Cloud Translation API"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Delegated credentials

Some providers do not provide fixed static credentials like API-keys or username/password pair but require you to use temporary tokens instead (like Google AutoML). So it imposes some extra work when using your own credentials — you have to regenerate these temporary credentials by yourself and provide them with each request to Intento. You have to know when you need to regenerate a token, or we let you know when we cannot fulfill a request using a provided token (because it was expired), so you can catch this situation, regenerate a token by yourself and continue using Intento API.

It is not very handy, because some tokens expire just after an hour, so you have to regenerate them each hour. Even if this process can be automated it takes much extra work: you need to catch this particular situation, regenerate a token, resend a bunch of requests which happen to be called with the expired token. The situation becomes harder when you run large async jobs that could take more time than a token lifetime. In this situation a part of such request will fail, so you need to split your requests into smaller parts or resubmit failed tasks with a new token. It is painful.

We provide a much more convenient and hassle-free way to work with temporary credentials. You can provide us with all the required information to generate temporary tokens. The fastest way to set up Google AutoML with Intento is our [Stored Credentials Manager](https://console.inten.to/credentials).

Another option is to [delegate us the required credentials through the API][delegated_credentials], and we take care of the whole process, automatically regenerating tokens when it's needed and substituting an actual token in the request to a provider. You pass a credential id (which is constant now), and we do all the job with translating it to always-working tokens.

A request with delegated credentials looks like this:

```sh
curl -XPOST -H 'apikey: YOUR_INTENTO_KEY' 'https://api.inten.to/ai/text/translate' -d '{
    "context": {
        "text": "epigenetics markers for treatment in a hospital setting ...",
        "from": "en",
        "to": "pt",
        "category": "projects/automl-196010/locations/us-central1/models/8254482168020221643"
    },
    "service": {
        "provider": "ai.text.translate.google.automl_api.v1beta1",
        "auth": {
            "ai.text.translate.google.automl_api.v1beta1": [
                {
                    "credential_id": "credentials_for_project_274"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}'
```

Here is the [instruction on how to create your own delegated credentials for different providers][delegated_credentials]. Right now this mode is supported only for `ai.text.translate.google.automl_api.v1beta1`.

### Smart routing

Intento provides the smart routing feature, so that the translation request is automatically routed to the best provider. The best provider is determined based on the following information:

- apriori benchmark on the standard dataset
- provider usage statistics, collected by Intento, including user feedback signals (the post-editing complexity for Machine Translation).

#### Basic smart routing

To use the smart routing, just omit the `service.provider` parameter:

```sh
curl -XPOST -H 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY' 'https://api.inten.to/ai/text/translate' -d '{
    "context": {
        "text": "A sample text",
        "to": "es"
    }
}'
```

Response:

```json
{
    "results": [
        "Un texto de ejemplo"
    ],
    "meta": {},
    "service": {
        "provider": {
            "id": "ai.text.translate.microsoft.translator_text_api.2-0",
            "name": "Microsoft Translator API"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Specifying the bidding strategy

By default, when the provider is missing, requests are routed to a provider with the best expected price/performance ratio. This behavior may be controlled by specifying the desired bidding strategy in the `service.bidding` parameter. Supported values are:

- `best` (default)
- `best_quality` - the best expected quality regardless of the price
- `best_price` - the cheapest provider
- `random` - a randomly chosen provider

```sh
curl -XPOST -H 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY' 'https://api.inten.to/ai/text/translate' -d '{
    "context": {
        "text": "A sample text",
        "to": "es"
    },
    "service": {
        "bidding": "best_quality"
    }
}'
```

### Failover mode

Both for smart routing mode and basic mode, a failover is supported. By default, the failover is off, thus when the selected provider fails, an error is returned. To enable the failover mode, set the `service.failover` to `true`. By default, failover is governed by the default bidding strategy (`best`). To control this behavior, another bidding strategy may be specified via `service.bidding` parameter. Alternatively, you may specify a list of providers to consider for the failover (`service.failover_list`). This option overrides the bidding strategy for the failover procedure.

In the following example we set the provider, but specify the list of alternatives to control the failover:

```sh
curl -XPOST -H 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY' 'https://api.inten.to/ai/text/translate' -d '{
    "context": {
        "text": "A sample text",
        "to": "es"
    },
    "service": {
        "provider": "ai.text.translate.microsoft.translator_text_api.2-0",
        "failover": true,
        "failover_list": [
            "ai.text.translate.google.translate_api.2-0",
            "ai.text.translate.yandex.translate_api.1-5"
        ]
    }
}'
```

### :lock: Sending feedback signals

In order to fine tune the smart routing algorithm, users may send the translation quality feedback.

For each translation, Intento returns its unique id in `service.id` field:

```json
{
    "results": [
        "Un texto de ejemplo"
    ],
    "service": {
        "id": "AVsAnRaMhIu3DcCXPJYY",
        "provider": {
            "id": "ai.text.translate.microsoft.translator_text_api.2-0",
            "name": "Microsoft Translator API"
        }
    }
}
```

This id may be used to send back the translation quality feedback:

```sh
curl -XPUT -H 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY' 'https://api.inten.to/ai/text/translate' -d '{
    "id": "AVsAnRaMhIu3DcCXPJYY",
    "feedback": {
        "type": "raw",
        "value": "A better text"
    }
}'
```

We support several types of the feedback:

- `raw` - raw post-edited text
- `fuzzy_word` - word-based inverted Levenstein distance
- `fuzzy_char` - character-based inverted Levenstein distance
- `time` - time spent on editing in seconds
- `effort` - an amount of mouse clicks and keyboard strokes spent on editing

### :lock: Session-based routing

The feedback signals sent back to Intento are used to fine-tune smart routing for all translations within language pair and domain for the user who sent the feedback.

To control this process, a user may specify the session as a `service.session` object with arbitrary string fields. We assume that sessions form some sort of hierarchy and do our best to infer it from the session data sent to Intento. Possible sessions may include:

```json
{
    "translator": "John Reed",
    "author": "Leo Tolstoy",
    "project": "War and Peace",
    "document": "Chapter one"
}
```

or

```json
{
    "author": "Leo Tolstoy",
    "project": "Anna Karenina"
}
```
